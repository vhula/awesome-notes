## Intro

### Machine learning definition

* Arthur Samuel (1959). Machine learning: Field of study that gives computers
the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

* Tom Mitchell (1988). Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said
to learn from experience **E** with respect to some task **T** and some
performance measure **P**, if its performance on T, as measured by **P**,
imroves with experience **E**.

### Machine learning algorithms

- Supervised learning (right answers are given)
    - _Regression_: predict continuous valued output(price, etc.)
    - _Classification_: discrete valued output (0 or 1)
- Unsupervised learning
    - "Cocktail party" problem
- Others: reinforcement learning, recommender systems
